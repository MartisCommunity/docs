# Download binaries

!!!
"Precompiled binaries" are the compiled version of the source code which is ready to run on your system. It is a convenient way to install the software without the need to compile it from source code, but needs to trust the source of the binaries.
!!!

To give an easier way to install the software, we provide precompiled binaries for different platforms. We support the following platforms:

- Windows
- Linux
- MacOS

To download the latest version available, please visit the Releases page.

If you don't see the precompiled binaries for your platform, you can always build from source code.

A comprehensive guide to build from source code is available here.

>We recommended building our software from source code directly, to be up-to-date but also to prevent having to trust a third party which could be a vector of attacks later.
